<!-- need this for user guess cleansing toLowerCase() -->

<!-- Track wins -->
<!-- Track losses -->
<!-- Track remaining guesses -->
<!-- Track letters guessed with prepending display to user -->
<!-- do not allow user to guess letters already guessed and not count them against remaining guesses -->
<!-- Pool of words to use -->
<!-- Will need to use var res = str.charAt(0); to access characters of the string -->




















<!-- You're going to make a game just like the one in the video. Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. Put the following text on your page:
Guess what letter I'm thinking of
Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)
Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)
When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).
When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins). -->
